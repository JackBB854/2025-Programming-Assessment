Welcome to üç≠ Candy land üç≠ ‚Äî your virtual sweet shop!

Here‚Äôs how this tasty adventure works:

1. You‚Äôll start by entering your name and setting a budget 
   (how much you‚Äôre allowed to spend).

2. You‚Äôll be shown a list of delicious sweets with their prices.

3. You can keep buying sweets (by choosing their number) as long 
   as you stay within your budget.

4. If you try to buy something more expensive than what 
   you can afford, you‚Äôll get a friendly reminder.

5. Once you can no longer afford any more sweets, the 
   program will end and say goodbye!

Let‚Äôs get snacking! üç¨üç´üç≠
